# Frogger.prototype: Cockroach Frenzy v1.0

### About Frogger.prototype: Cockroach Frenzy

Frogger.prototype: Cockroach Frenzy is a html5 version of the legendary Frogger arcade game, guaranteed to be at least 5 times more tedious!
It has been created as a project for Udacity Front End Web Developer NanoDegree.

### Bugs are there to crush you!

In a remote secret bunker built in the middle of Somewherestan desert, a nuclear experiment went wrong...
A huge colony of ugly cockroaches fleed from the bunker's kitchen, crossing a strange laser beam that weirdly altered their DNA.
Now they're as big as a truck and running wild!

### Your goal

The 30 gems powering the laser have been blasted away by a series of explosions: they went so high in the sky that are actually still falling... Unfortunately they are pouring down on Somewherestan's most Cockroach-trafficked highway!
Collect as many gems as you can, without getting roadkilled by those giant annoying bugs...
If you collect all the 30 gems, scientists may be able to rebuild the laser, invert the beam and kill the bugs!

## Move your character

Use up/down/left/right arrow keys to move around, but beware: the lake next to the highway has been heavily polluted by radioactive fallout! Taking a bath is not recommended.

### Stayin' alive

Even your body has been exposed to radiation: now you have 3 hearts! And if you're lucky enough you may find another extra heart!
